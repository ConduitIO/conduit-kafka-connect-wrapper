[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=conduit-kafka-connect-wrapper&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=conduit-kafka-connect-wrapper)

### Conduit's Kafka connector wrapper 
The goal of Conduit's Kafka connector wrapper is to make it possible to use existing Kafka connectors with Conduit.

### Pre-requisites
* JDK 20
* Currently, only Unix-like OSes are supported.

### Logging
The connector exposes a gRPC streaming method, `plugin.GRPCStdio/StreamStdio`, through which logs are sent to Conduit.

### Development
The complete server-side code for this plugin is **not** committed to the repo. Rather, it's generated from the proto files,
when the project is compiled. 

In a few integration tests we use [Aiven's JDBC connector](https://github.com/aiven/jdbc-connector-for-apache-kafka).
Since it's not available in public Maven repositories, it needs to be compiled and installed to a local Maven repository,
so it can be used. For convenience, we provide a prebuilt JAR (in the `libs` directory).

1. Run `mvn install:install-file -Dfile=libs/jdbc-connector-for-apache-kafka-6.7.0.jar -DgroupId=io.aiven -DartifactId=jdbc-connector-for-apache-kafka -Dversion=6.7.0 -Dpackaging=jar`
2. Run `mvn clean compile` (so that the needed code is generated)
3. Some IDEs may not automatically use the generated sources. If that's the case, you need to change the project settings in your IDE to include the generated source. In IntelliJ, for example, you do that by going
to File > Project structure > Project Settings > Modules. Then, right-click on `target/generated-source` and select "Sources".

### Code quality
Code analysis is done through SonarCloud, where we have a [conduitio](https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=conduit-kafka-connect-wrapper) organization.

The `sonarcloud-analysis` GitHub workflow utilizes the Maven `sonar:sonar` goal, which requests an analysis on SonarCloud. 
Once the analysis is complete, SonarCloud will update the pull request's check. That can sometimes take a couple of minutes. 
That means that when this check passes, that doesn't automatically mean that the code quality check passed to.

When developing, you can the [SonarLint plugin](https://www.sonarlint.org/), which is available for major IDEs.

For the analysis to work, a Sonar token is needed. It's stored as a GitHub repository secret named `SONAR_TOKEN`. The token
can be generated by going to the [SonarCloud project](https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=conduit-kafka-connect-wrapper),
then Configure > Choose your Analysis Method: > With GitHub Actions. Here's the [direct link](https://sonarcloud.io/project/configuration?id=conduit-kafka-connect-wrapper&analysisMode=GitHubActions) at the time of writing this.

**Note regarding code coverage**: SonarCloud's built-in quality gate requires all new code to have at least 80% test coverage.
However, in some cases that may not be required, e.g. when simply a variable was renamed. To work with those cases, we 
have a quality gate with 0% required coverage. Stating the obvious, that should only be used in rare cases, it should be
noted in a PR, and the quality gate should be set back to the default one after the PR is done.

#### Building and using the connector
At a high level, to use this wrapper, you need to:
1. Build it
2. Put any Kafka connector JARs you may need into the `libs` directory.
3. Create a Conduit connector configuration, where the plugin path is the path to `conduit-kafka-connect-wrapper`.
4. Add the Kafka connector configuration you'd normally use.

Let's go into more details of this:

Run `scripts/dist.sh` to build an executable. `scripts/dist.sh` will create a directory called `dist` with following contents:
1. A script (which runs the connector). This script starts a connector instance.
2. The connector JAR itself
3. Directory `libs`. This is where you put the Kafka connector JARs and their dependencies (if any).

When creating a Conduit connector, the plugin path you need to use is the path to `conduit-kafka-connect-wrapper`. Here's
a full working example of a Conduit connector configuration:
```json
{
  "type": "TYPE_SOURCE",
  "plugin": "/home/conduit-dev/projects/conduitio/conduit-kafka-connect-wrapper/dist/conduit-kafka-connect-wrapper",
  "pipeline_id": "f24c4a70-8664-4f80-9c27-204825442943",
  "config": {
    "name": "my-pg-source",
    "settings": {
      "wrapper.connector.class": "io.aiven.connect.jdbc.JdbcSourceConnector",
      "connection.url": "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/conduit-test-db",
      "connection.user": "username",
      "connection.password": "password",
      "incrementing.column.name": "id",
      "mode": "incrementing",
      "tables": "customers",
      "topic.prefix": "my_topic_prefix"
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the `wrapper.connector.class` should be a class which is present on the classpath, i.e. in one of the JARs in
the `libs` directory. For more information, theck the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

#### Download a connector and its dependencies

To download a connector from a Maven repository and all of its dependencies, you can use `scripts/download-connector.sh`.
For example:
```shell
./scripts/download-connector.sh io.example jdbc-connector 2.1.3
```

### Loading connectors
The plugin will load connectors and all the other dependencies from a `libs` directory, which is expected to be in the 
same directory as the plugin executable itself. For example, if the plugin executable is at `/abc/def/conduit-kafka-connect-wrapper`,
then the dependencies are expected to be in `/abc/def/libs`.

The plugin will be able to find the dependencies as soon as they are put into `libs`. Please note that, a JDBC connector 
(generally) will require a database-specific driver to work (for example, PostgreSQL's driver can be found 
[here](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.postgresql/postgresql)).

#### Configuration
This plugin's configuration consists of the configuration of the requested Kafka connector, plus:

| Name                                    | Description                                                                                                         | Required                                                              | Default | Example                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| `wrapper.schema.autogenerate.overrides` | A (partial) schema which overrides types in the auto-generated schema.                                              | no                                                                    | none    | `{"type":"struct","fields":[{"type":"boolean","optional":true,"field":"joined"}],"name":"customers"}`                                                                                               |

Here's a full example, for a new Conduit destination connector, backed up by a JDBC Kafka sink connector.
```json
{
  "wrapper.connector.class": "io.aiven.connect.jdbc.JdbcSourceConnector",
  "connection.url": "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/test-db",
  "connection.user": "test-user",
  "connection.password": "Passw0rd",
  "incrementing.column.name": "id",
  "mode": "incrementing",
  "tables": "my_table",
  "topic.prefix": "my_topic_prefix"
}
```

All the configuration parameters prefixed with `wrapper.` belong to the Kafka Connect wrapper and is used to control its
behavior. All other configuration parameters are forwarded to the underlying Kafka connector as-is. In this example, 
`wrapper.connector.class` is telling the wrapper to instantiate a JDBC source connector. `connection.url` and all the other
parameters are specific to the JDBC source connector.

### Schema auto-generation
If `schema.autogenerate.enabled` is set to `true`, the plugin will try to automatically generate Kafka connector schemas 
for a destination. If schema auto-generation is enabled, then a schema name must be provided (through the `schema.autogenerate.name` parameters).

Optionally, it's possible to override types for individual fields. This is useful in cases where the plugin's inferred type
for a field is not suitable. To override types for individual fields, specify a schema through `schema.autogenerate.overrides`.
The specified schema is, of course, partial. 

Here's an example:
```json
{
    "type": "struct",
    "fields":
    [
        {
            "type": "boolean",
            "optional": false,
            "field": "joined"
        }
    ],
    "name": "customers"
}
```

In this example we specify a partial schema, where a single field, `joined`, is defined. Schema generator will skip its
own specifications for this field and instead use the provided one.

Schema auto-generation works differently for records with structured data and records with raw data.
1. Records with structured data: A record with structured data contains a `google.protobuf.Struct`. The mappings are as
follows:

| `google.protobuf.Struct` (protobuf) | Kafka schema                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| bool                                | OPTIONAL_BOOLEAN_SCHEMA                                                           |
| number (only double is supported)   | OPTIONAL_FLOAT64_SCHEMA                                                           |
| string                              | OPTIONAL_STRING_SCHEMA                                                            |
| NullValue                           | STRUCT                                                                            |
| ListValue                           | ARRAY, where element types correspond to element type from the protobuf ListValue |

2. Records with raw data, in JSON format: The mappings are as follows:

| JSON    | Kafka schema                                         |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------|
| OBJECT  | STRUCT                                               |
| STRING  | OPTIONAL_STRING_SCHEMA                               |
| NUMBER  | the narrowest integer or float schema for the number |
| BOOLEAN | boolean                                              |

3. Records with raw  data, and no schema at all - not supported (yet).
